# Pathways

**Pathway membership from KEGG and Reactome, value is binary, i.e. `0` or `1`**

The knowledge base contains complete pathway data from **KEGG** and **Reactome** database. There are 360 pathways available in KEGG and 2725 pathways available in Reactome. This pathway information can be mapped on the network or executing real-time functional enrichment analysis from the interface. Each pathway contains different genes, and the original data looks like below:

In Node Color section, when you click on a specific pathway name in the dropdown list of "Pathways" feature, you will see red colors rendered in the network, indicating the genes in the selected pathway. You can select **multiple** pathways. The name of each pathway follows the format of **\{database name}\_\{pathway name}**, for example, "Reactome_Autophagy", shown as below:

For more information about each pathway, please refer to the following databases:

- [Reactome Pathways](https://reactome.org/)
