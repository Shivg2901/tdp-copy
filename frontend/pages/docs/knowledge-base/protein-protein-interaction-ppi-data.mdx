# Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) data

In the current version of the portal, protein interaction network data is curated from 3 different sources: [STRING database](https://string-db.org/), [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home) and [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/). The network in the network visualization page is constructed based on these 3 different databases.
