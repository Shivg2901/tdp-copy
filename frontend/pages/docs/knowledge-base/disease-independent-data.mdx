# Disease-independent data

**Disease-independent** data DO NOT vary with different diseases, including [Target Prioritization Factors](knowledge-base/disease-independent-data/target-prioritization-factors.mdx) (_Rank and prioritize biological targets_), [Pathway](disease-independent-data/pathway.mdx) (_Pathway membership from MSigDB_), [Druggability](disease-independent-data/druggability.mdx) (_Derived from DrugnomeAI_), [Tissue Enrichment](disease-independent-data/tissue-enrichment.mdx) (_Tissue-specific expression from GTEX and HPA_).
