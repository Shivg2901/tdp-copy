# Knowledge Base

**Various data available in your network visualization**

The knowledge base provides the node and edge properties of network visualization and analysis, based on the [Reference Genome data](./knowledge-base/reference-genome-data.mdx) and [Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network data](./knowledge-base/protein-protein-interaction-ppi-data.mdx).

We also have different kinds of data available on the left panel of network visualization page, which allows you to change the network property based on personal needs. The data behind each feature is divided into 2 different types -- **disease-dependent** and **disease independent**.

Data types are transformed to defined representations, so that they can be handled consistently and displayed intuitively by the frontend.

- **Disease-dependent** data varies with different diseases, including [LogFC](knowledge-base/disease-dependent-data/logfc.mdx) (_Differential expression in Log2 fold change_), [GDA](knowledge-base/disease-dependent-data/gda.mdx)(_Gene Disease Association score_) and [Genetics](knowledge-base/disease-dependent-data/genetics.mdx) (_Odd ratio or Beta-values from population studies_).

- **Disease-independent** data DO NOT vary with different diseases, including [Target Prioritization Factors](knowledge-base/disease-independent-data/target-prioritization-factors.mdx) (_Rank and prioritize biological targets_), [Pathway](knowledge-base/disease-independent-data/pathway.mdx) (_Pathway membership from KEGG and Reactome_), [Druggability](knowledge-base/disease-independent-data/druggability.mdx) (_Derived from DrugnomeAI_), [Tissue Enrichment](knowledge-base/disease-independent-data/tissue-enrichment.mdx) (_Tissue-specific expression from GTEX and HPA_).
